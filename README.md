# App Details 

This app utilizes the NPM API alongside a redux-reducer to surface different application states (depending on whether or not there is a loading, error or success state) and in the base case, display a text box which accepts a search term from a use and will render results to the screen relating to the entered search term which we fetch from the NPM API.
